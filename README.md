# Address Book System (JavaScript) 🚀  

This repository implements an **Address Book System** in JavaScript, developed **UC-wise (Use Case wise)** with each UC merged step by step into the `main` branch.  

---

## 🌟 **Project Workflow: UC-wise Merging Strategy**
Each **Use Case (UC)** is developed in a separate branch and merged sequentially into `main`.  

```bash
main  <- uc1  <- uc2  <- uc3  <- uc4  <- uc5  <- uc6  <- uc7  <- uc8  <- uc9  <- uc10  <- uc11  <- uc12

```

🔗 Merging Steps  
uc1 ➝ Basic Address Book Contact Creation ✅  
uc2 ➝ Validation of Contact Fields ✅  
uc3 ➝ Creating an Address Book Array ✅  
uc4 ➝ Editing an Existing Contact ✅  
uc5 ➝ Deleting a Contact from the Address Book ✅  
uc6 ➝ Counting the Total Contacts ✅  
uc7 ➝ Preventing Duplicate Entries ✅  
uc8 ➝ Searching a Person by City or State ✅  
uc9 ➝ Viewing Persons Grouped by City or State ✅  
uc10 ➝ Counting Persons by City or State ✅  
uc11 ➝ Sorting the Address Book Alphabetically by Name ✅  
uc12 ➝ Sorting the Address Book by City, State, or Zip ✅

🛠 Project Functionalities  
The Address Book System includes the following functionalities:  

✔️ CRUD Operations:  
Add, Edit, and Delete Contacts from the address book.  

✔️ Validation:  
Validate contact details such as Name, Address, City, State, Zip, Phone, and Email.  

✔️ Duplicate Prevention:  
Prevent adding contacts with the same name.  

✔️ Search:  
Find contacts based on City or State.  

✔️ Grouping:  
View contacts grouped by City or State.  

✔️ Counting:  
Count the total number of contacts and the number of contacts grouped by City or State.  

✔️ Sorting:  
Sort the address book alphabetically by Name, and by City, State, or Zip.
